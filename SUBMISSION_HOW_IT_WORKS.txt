Polyseek Sentient Agent uses a 3-phase parallel architecture to automate prediction market analysis:

Phase 1: Parallel Data Collection (~10-15s)
Three tasks run simultaneously: (1) Fetch market metadata from official APIs (Polymarket/Kalshi), (2) Scrape comments and resolution rules from HTML, (3) Gather external signals from News API, X/Twitter, and RSS feeds. Parallel processing reduces data collection time from 45s to 15s.

Phase 2: LLM-Based Analysis (~20s Quick / ~105s Deep)
Quick mode uses single-pass reasoning: aggregates all data into a comprehensive prompt and generates structured JSON with verdict, confidence, key drivers, uncertainty factors, and sources. Deep mode uses 4-step reasoning: Planner → Critic → Follow-up → Final, with bias mitigation through Devil's Advocate mode that forces consideration of counter-arguments.

Phase 3: Report Formatting (<1s)
Validates JSON schema, generates Markdown report, deduplicates sources, and outputs structured JSON + Markdown with all claims backed by source citations.

Key Features:
- Parallel processing: 3x faster than sequential
- Bias mitigation: Devil's Advocate mode and explicit uncertainty factors
- Structured output: JSON for APIs, Markdown for humans
- Flexible modes: Quick (30s) for speed, Deep (120s) for comprehensive analysis

Result: Transforms manual 30+ minute analysis into automated 30-120 second workflow with evidence-based insights.

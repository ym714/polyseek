Polyseek automates prediction market analysis through a 3-phase parallel architecture:

1. Parallel Data Collection (~10-15s): Simultaneously fetches market data from APIs, scrapes comments from HTML, and gathers external signals from news/social media. Parallel processing reduces time from 45s to 15s.

2. LLM-Based Analysis (~20s Quick / ~105s Deep): Quick mode uses single-pass reasoning to synthesize all data into structured verdicts with confidence scores, key drivers, and sources. Deep mode uses 4-step reasoning (Planner → Critic → Follow-up → Final) with bias mitigation through Devil's Advocate mode.

3. Report Formatting (<1s): Validates JSON schema, generates Markdown, and outputs structured reports with all claims backed by source citations.

Key innovations: Parallel processing (3x faster), bias mitigation (Devil's Advocate + uncertainty factors), flexible modes (Quick for speed, Deep for depth).

Result: Transforms manual 30+ minute analysis into automated 30-120 second workflow.
